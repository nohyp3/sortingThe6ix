# sortingThe6ix
Look around you... do you have food wrappers and packaging lying around?
How about when you go outside and don't know where to throw your takeout?
That's why we made Sort The 6ix, a React Native App that will detect objects and tell you where to dispose of them according to the City of Toronto!
